Financial Analysis
----------------------------
A : Total Months: 86
B : Total: $38382578
C : Average Change: -2315.12
D : Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-12 ($1926159)
E : Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-13 ($-2196167)
-----------------------------------------------------
# Evaluation: 
    We would need three lists : months, revenue and revenue_change
    A can be calculated as length of list months : len(months)
    B can be calculated as sum of list revenue   : sum(revenue)
    C can be calculated as sum of revenue_change / total changes :  sum(revenue_change)/len(revenue_change)
    D - This required two things : greatest increase in profit and month of greatest increase in profit
         Greatest increase in profit :  max(revenue_change)
         Month of greatest increase in profit : This will be equal to index of maximum revenue_change
                                        index ---> revenue_change.index(max(revenue_change)
                                        month of corresponding index  : months[index]
    E - This will be calculated similarly as D.
